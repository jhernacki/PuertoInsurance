# PuertoInsurance
Creating models to handle an imbalanced binary classification problem.


In here you will find three R files

get_clean.R:<br> 
      is as it says about cleaning the data. While the variables had no description, there was still a lot of missing data to be handled         as well as tasks such as checking correlations.
      
InsuranceProb.R:
      Here is where a majority of models were built including Logistic Regression, Trees and some very basic Neural Networks.
      
lda.R:
      This file shows in a little more detail some of what into the models testing. This same strategy was used for QDA, KNN and many           others.
