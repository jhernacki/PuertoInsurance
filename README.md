# PuertoInsurance
Creating models to handle an imbalanced binary classification problem.


In here you will find three R files

1. **get_clean.R:** <br> <br>
      is as it says about cleaning the data. While the variables had no description, there was still a lot of missing data to be handled         as well as tasks such as checking correlations.
      
2. **InsuranceProb.R:**<br> <br>
      Here is where a majority of models were built including Logistic Regression, Trees and some very basic Neural Networks.
      
3. **lda.R:**<br> <br>
      This file shows in a little more detail some of what into the models testing. This same strategy was used for QDA, KNN and many           others.
